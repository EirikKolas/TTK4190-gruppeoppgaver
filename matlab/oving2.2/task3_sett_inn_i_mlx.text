3a) The main intention of a wave filter (low pass filter) in model based navigation is to filter out noise. 
This is because we do not want the system to compensate for the wave frequencies, only the useful measurements. 


b) The main difference between model based navigation and INS is that INS uses internal sensor data to determine
its position and orientation, whereas model based navigation rely on mathematical predictions. 
INS in contrast to model based navigation is at risk of accumulating error leading to drift. 
However this is spossible to correct if using external data.
